$$$$$$$$$ CODE THAT I WILL NEED DURING THE GAME $$$$$$$$$$

let currentPlayerLocation = 'street';


let answer = wait ask
let differentAnswer = await ask


let validInputs = [];


\n

else {
    console.log(`I'm sorry, I don't understand ${answer}.`);
    differentAnswer = await ask ("Try again");
    
    while (checkTheAnswer(differentAnswer) === false) {
      differentAnswer = await ask (`Try again\n`);
    }
};


function that checks if an answer contains the words that we need to move on:

function checkTheAnswer (answer) {
  let wordsNeeded = ['ex', 'ex2'];

  let result = answer.includes(wordsNeeded);

}

How do I check for two words on a string using include()?

if(str.includes("a") && str.includes("b")) {
console.log(a and b received)
}
